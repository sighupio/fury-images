# fury-images

This repository contains CI and definition files to build and push general-purpose container images.

Please note that these are **not** the images used by Kubernetes Fury Distribution Modules, even though the repository name could suggest that (see [#65](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-images/issues/65)). For KFD Modules images refer to: https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution-container-image-sync
